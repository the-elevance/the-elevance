## About Us

We're building an elite freelance platform designed to highlight top developers, where skilled professionals are carefully verified and showcased for clients. Hourly rates for verified developers will start at $30, and our onboarding process will ensure only the highest standards, helping clients find the right talent with confidence.

Our project is led by a developer with extensive experience in building top-tier freelance platforms, along with a strong background in managing and leading both the technical and strategic sides of startups. This gives us deep insights into the technical and user needs of such systems. We’re fully aware of the challenges these platforms face, from exclusivity issues to limited scalability. Our goal is to build a scalable, inclusive platform that directly addresses these challenges, offering greater accessibility and opportunity for skilled developers and clients alike.

Why This Platform?
Our strategy starts with our strengths in outstaffing and outsourcing services, allowing us to generate early revenue and expand our network. This approach lets us take on projects as a Core team, growing both our client and developer communities while we develop a strong base.

Open-Source and Contributor Rewards
We’re developing this platform as an open-source project and inviting contributors to join us at this early stage. Contributors will gain access to mentorship and rewards based on their level of involvement. Up to 50 contributors will have exclusive access to guided mentorship and structured rewards for their work on the platform.
